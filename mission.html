                The mission of “The Citizens of the Planet Earth” is to bring about peace and cooperation among all people inhabiting ‘The Planet Earth.’ <br>

Our goal is to bring about a mutual respect for all human beings on the “Planet Earth” by having each induvial person agree to and become knowledgeable of the United Nations “Universal Declaration of Inalienable Human Rights.”
The individual person would then contractually sign and agree to all or a select few of the U.N. listed Inalienable Human Rights, that they are willing to uphold in kind to their fellow “Citizens of the Planet Earth” and thus becomes a “Citizen of the Planet Earth”.
To further our commitment of respect for one another’s inalienable rights the “Citizens of the Planet Earth” shall institute and maintain a worldwide website electronic opinion poll to record their opinion on governmental concerns, including local, state, national and international. Hopefully, our world leaders will take notice and learn to use peaceful means to resolve conflicts without armed conflict. Through this worldwide opinion poll, humanity will be able to make known the true will of the “Citizens of Planet Earth.” <br>
<br>


Goals of the Citizens of the Planet Earth are:<br><br>
1.Universal Reorganization of Inalienable Human Rights of Every Individual:<br>
To have each and every individual person on “The Planet Earth” recognize and define the Inalienable Human Rights”* they are willing to extend and uphold to each and every individual person on “The Planet Earth”
<br><br>
2. Individual Opinion Recording Poll:<br>
 To institute and maintain a secure electronic opinion recording capability for all “The Citizens of Planet Earth” to record their opinion on local, state, national and international legislation and concerns.

<br><br>
3.Individual Responsibility:<br>
