          <h2>Thomas LeRoy Francis Kelly’s Story</h2>
            <p>
            <br>
            <br>
                The story of the initiator of “The Citizens of the Planet Earth” website.
            <br>
            <br>
              Born November 2, 1948 and raised in Waterbury Connecticut, USA, an
              industrial metal working city famed for mechanical equipment and metal parts that
              supplied the allied armies of World War I and II. Raised with an Irish immigrant
              grandfather, his father was a navigator in the US Navy submarine service and taught
              building construction design and techniques in the Connecticut state schools.<br>
              
              Mr Kelly was educated in Roman Catholic Christian schools, he pursued the priesthood for
              four years at LaSalette seminary during the US Vietnam war conflict, he had an
              understanding from French Missionaries thrown out of Vietnam after World War II
              that the Vietnam conflict was a war of self rule and independence of French colonial
              form of self government. The 1945 colonial French rule of Indochina was overturned and
              the self determination of nations was agreed to after World War II in the Potsdam
              Treaty. After all colonialism by militarily stronger European nations was a main
              cause for the World Wars of the 19th and 20th century.<br> 
              
              Tom Kelly reasoned in conscience
              that the Vietnam War was unjust politically and if the will of the Vietnamese people
              was to choose a socialist-communist form of political order it was their individual
              right under the U.S. Declaration of independence. He also reasoned the military
              weapons of destruction now employed by human kind would nullify any Judeo-
              Christian ‘just war moral theory of killing in self defense’ and he filed for
              conscientious objector status with the US Draft Board on the political freedom of
              choice and the moral religious conscientious reasoning that the Vietnam War was
              unjust. The US draft board does not recognize selective conscientious objection to
              war, you must be against all war which the Catholic religion is not. Tom Kelly was a
              felon refusing to serve his country and prepared legally to argue in a court of law the
              political and moral reasons that the Vietnam Conflict-War was an unjust war
              politically and religiously. Because there were too many felons avoiding the
              Vietnam War draft, Mr. Kelly’s case was not heard in a court of law.<br>
              Mr Kelly then
              dedicated his life and non work time pursuing how world peace and international
              cooperation could take place on planet earth. He read political philosophies and
              government organization. He studied history and the causes of human armed
              conflict. He researched the major religions of the world and read their sacred books.
              He has come to envision that all human kind are one people and can live in peace
              and sharing cooperation throughout “The Planet Earth.”
            <br>
            <br>
              The first step in bringing about peace and cooperation for all human kind on The Planet Earth is to
              define the individual human rights we will uphold to our
              fellow human beings throughout the planet earth.
            <br> 
            <br>
              Second when a majority of individuals in the world recognize that inalienable
              rights of individuals come before the rights of any government or leader, we the
              citizens of The Planet Earth then take on the responsibility to uphold these rights to each and every
              individual person on this planet earth. This responsibility to preserve individual
              rights supersedes and is ahead of any local, state, national or international
              government decrees or laws. It is our individual responsibility to guide our leaders in
              the will of the people for all the people of the world.
             <br> 
             <br>
              Third, by providing an electronic means that every individual person of The Planet Earth can vote their
              opinion daily on local, state, national and international concerns. Each individual can
              be and the collective will of the people be recorded to direct our elected
              government officials in the 21st century to act in the true Will of the People.
            <br> 
            <br>
              Mr. Kelly’s thinking inspiration is to make available to each and every
              individual person on the “Planet earth” a means that his opinion can be counted on
              the issues that affect our societies. By recording this consensus opinion on matters of
              concern, the people of the earth, each and every individual can direct their political
              and religious leaders to do <u>"The Will of the People".</u> This electronic website of <u>“The
              Citizens of The Planet Earth”</u> must be independent of any and all political and
              religious organization’s control that could miss-report the results or inform the
              public in a one sided manner. The citizens of the planet earth opinion poll voting
              website and each individual citizens voting space must be free of manipulation from
              self interested parties and government.
             <br>
             <br>
                The world has evolved into a global economy and if global commerce of
                goods and services stops, so does the life support system of every person on the
                planet earth.<br>
            
                Through respect of eachother rights liberties and freedoms we shall live together in peace and harmony thoughthe planet earth
